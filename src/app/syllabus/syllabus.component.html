   <h1>Syllabus</h1>
   <p>
      Policies and background for IN4MATX 133, Winter 2022 Quarter. 
      <span class="tbd">All syllabus content is subject to change, particularly prior to the start of the quarter. In particular, if there are phrasings which do not make sense for the virtual nature of the quarter, please let Professor Epstein know and he will correct or clarify.</span>
   </p>
   <h2>Course Description</h2>
   <p>From the <a href="http://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=IN4MATX%20133">catalog</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>Introduction to human-computer interaction programming. Emphasis on current tools, standards, methodologies for implementing effective interaction designs. Widget toolkits, Web interface programming, geo-spatial and map interfaces, mobile phone interfaces.</blockquote>
   <p></p>
   <p>In practice, every instructor takes a slightly different bend to these topics. I focus on covering modern technologies for web and mobile development and how device capabilities can impact interface design and software architecture.</p>
   <p>All students must have taken <a href="http://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=I%26C%20SCI%2045J">I&amp;C SCI 45J</a> or <a href="http://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=I%26C%20SCI%2045C">I&amp;C SCI 45C</a> with a C or higher. This course will also assume students have mastered material in prior courses.</p>
   <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
   <p>At the end of this course, students should be able to:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Program web applications in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which are sensitive to screen size and a person's abilities</li>
      <li>Leverage external data sources and APIs via asynchronous HTTP requests</li>
      <li>Develop hybrid mobile applications which take advantage of on-device utilities</li>
      <li>Describe affordances of different screen modalities and input techniques</li>
      <li>Choose an appropriate web or mobile development framework for a given task</li>
      <li>Implement and articulate best practices for authentication, storage, and communication in web and mobile</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Format</h2>
   <p>Delivery of course content will be <strong>synchronous, but lectures will be recorded</strong>. In alignment with assessment of <a href="syllabus#participation">participation</a>, attendance at lecture is strongly encouraged, but not required for credit for participation.</p>
   <p>In accordance with <a href="https://news.uci.edu/2021/12/22/uci-announces-winter-quarter-to-begin-with-remote-instruction/">UCI's policies</a>, the first two weeks of class will be conducted fully remotely over Zoom. After this period, we plan to offer sessions in-person as well as remote, delivering the lectures and discussions in-person, livestreaming them to Zoom, and posting the recordings. However, we will continue to monitor the University's guidance and policies.</p>
   <p>To avoid close contact in small spaces, all office hours will be conducted over Zoom. We aim to have at least one in-person session, likely outside, later in the quarter. If you are feeling ill, have tested positive, etc., <strong>do not come to any in-person course sessions</strong>.</p>
   <p>Discussion sections are optional, but attending is a great opportunity to consult with the course staff and classmates. We will aim to select discussion topics which are of benefit to students in the class. To keep discussion sizes manageable, students should ideally attend the discussion section they are registered for, but this is not required.</p>
   <h3 id="electronics">Use of Electronics in Lecture</h3>
   <p>In a remote format, you clearly need to use devices during lecture and discussion! But we encourage you to limit your use of other devices, apps, websites, etc. The evidence is clear: students <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0956797614524581">take worse notes</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01443410.2018.1489046">perform worse on exams</a> when they use devices during lectures. We will do our best to ensure synchronous material delivery is worthwhile, and we hope students come to class excited to learn.</p>
   <h2>Communication</h2>
   <p>Slack Channel: <a href="https://uci-inf-133-wi22.slack.com">https://uci-inf-133-wi22.slack.com</a>. Sign up <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/uci-inf-133-wi22/signup">here</a>.</p>
   <p>Course Staff Email: <a href="mailto:informatics-133-staff@uci.edu">informatics-133-staff@uci.edu</a></p>
   <p>The course staff gets a lot of email from the University, other faculty, staff, and students about all sorts of topics. In a class as large as this one, it’s easy for student questions to get lost. Our course Slack channel is therefore the best way to discuss assignment questions or clarifications. This lets you get support and advice from the whole class, not only the course staff. Slack is also more conducive to the resolving the types of questions which typically arise when programming.</p>
   <p>To enable the whole class to offer support, questions or clarifications should be posted to the public channels on Slack. The course staff will not respond to direct messages on Slack, except possibly as a private follow-up to a public question. If you have a question which is personal in nature (e.g., about a grade, about an absence), please email it.</p>
   <p>When you do send an email, please send it to the course list rather than emailing Professor Epstein directly. Doing so will help ensure the message does not get lost and will help the entire course staff stay informed.</p>
   <p>This course will be <strong>Slack-first</strong>. This means that updates to the course, etc. will usually be shared on Slack first and may or may not be repeated over email or in class.</p>
   <h2>Required Text and Materials</h2>
   <p>Given the rapid changes in web and mobile development, any materials relying on a particular technology will quickly lose their value as a reference material. Articles online serve as a great resource, and all required materials will be made available. Check the <a href="/resources">resources</a> tab for some pointers, and feel free to send the course staff any resources you find useful as the course progresses.</p>
   <h2>Assessment</h2>
   <p>Grades will be calculated as follows:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Assignments: 90%</li>
      <ul>
         <li>A0: Getting to Know You, Getting to Know Us (1%)</li>
         <li>A1: Responsive Portfolio in HTML and CSS (18%)</li>
         <li>A2: Runkeeper Tweet Report in JavaScript and TypeScript (18%)</li>
         <li>A3: Spotify Browser in Angular (18%)</li>
         <li>A4: Sleep Tracker in Ionic (18%)</li>
         <li>A5: Beyond Web & Mobile (17%)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Participation: 10% (up to 5% extra credit)</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Lecture-based participation (10%)</li>
         <li>Slack participation (5%)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Professional penalty: up to -100%. We expect students to be respectful to course staff and classmates, and unprofessionalism can be held against a student when calculating final grades. UCI's <a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/policies/pacaos/grounds-for-discipline.php">Grounds for Discipline</a> describes the types of cases where this penalty could be applied. This penalty will only be assessed in extreme cases; we will give a warning prior to any action.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Areas may be curved to ensure grades align with student successes toward learning objectives. We expect any curve would be "up" rather than "down".</p>
   <p>Passing the course requires completion of A0. Grades follow the <a href="https://www.reg.uci.edu/services/transcripts/notations.html">official UCI policies</a> (e.g., D- and above are passing grades).</p>
   <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
   <p>Git and GitHub are among the most popular tools for managing code today. To give you practice with these tools, the starter code for assignments is therefore available through <a href="https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/40613500-uci-inf-133">GitHub Classroom</a>, which will automatically create a repository for you. UCI has not yet enabled Canvas integration with GitHub Classroom, so your repository must still be uploaded to <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/32801">Canvas</a>.</p>
   <h3 id="duedates">Assignment Due Dates</h3>
   <p>Unless otherwise specified, all assignments are due “at the end of the day” on whatever date is listed on the calendar. In practice, we will implement this on Canvas as 11:59pm Pacific <strong>(note time zone)</strong> that day.</p>
   <h3>Late Assignments</h3>
   <p>Late assignments will be assessed a 15% penalty for each 24-hour period after the due date. Assignments more than two days late will not be accepted without advance permission.</p>
   <p>Given the wide-ranging impacts of COVID-19 on everyday life, <strong>the course staff is willing to grant extensions within reason when requested</strong>. We ask that you don't request extensions when they are not necessary, as assignments build on one another and delays can snowball. But COVID-19 and the virtual format introduces a higher degree personal disruptions than in a typical quarter, and we aim to be flexible.</p>
   <p>To request an extension, email the course staff at least 24 hours before the assignment due date. Late extension requests may be accommodated in exceptional circumstances, but shouldn't be expected. Include in your email when you now plan to submit the assignment. A typical extension would be for a few days, a week at most. To ensure that we can submit final grades on time, <strong>we will not grant extensions on the last assignment</strong>. We also reserve the right to refuse any extension (a second extension, for example). All <a href="syllabus#integrity">academic integrity</a> policies continue to apply to late submissions.</p>
   <h3>Exams</h3>
   <p>There will be no exams for this offering of 133, with further weight being placed on other assessments.</p>
   <h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
   <p>The easiest way to obtain full participation points (10%) is to participate in every lecture. While synchronous participation is strongly preferred, it is not mandatory. Lecture participation will be operationalized through responding to questions (polls) on the <a href="/questions">questions page</a> posed during lecture (~2 per class, none during discussion). Peer instruction questions is a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2016911.2016923">proven</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1119/1.1474140">technique</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2839509.2844642">for</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1119/1.1374249">facilitating</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2445196.2445250">learning</a>. Questions will follow a think & share format. Students will first respond individually, discuss responses with the class, and finally the correct answer will be revealed and explained. If you are unable to attend synchronously, you can receive full credit respond to the polls within 24 hours of the end of lecture.</p>
   <p>The correctness of responses will *not* be evaluated, only whether a student submitted a response on their registered device. Participation grade will be assessed by counting the number of responses submitted on-time, divided by the total number of questions. To account for help account for conflicts, etc. during the quarter, we will drop four questions from the participation grade (e.g., a student can miss four questions, or roughly two lectures and still get full participation credit). Again, if you have an exceptional circumstance, please email the course staff. Given the drop policy, it is possible that no additional action will be taken.</p>
   <p>You may additionally gain up to 5% bonus participation credit by frequently answering other student's questions on Slack. The course staff will monitor the public channels and keep a record of students who are frequently participating. We do not have a strict threshold for receiving full bonus participation credit, as this depends on the number of questions being asked throughout the quarter. But we expect successfully helping your peers with 3-5 questions per assignment will receive full bonus points.</p>
   <p>The full 10% can be achieved by participating in every lecture (or every minus two), frequent Slack answering, or a combination of the two. Students who do both exceptionally (e.g., answer frequent questions and attend every class but two) may earn up to 5% extra credit.</p>
   <h3>Re-grading</h3>
   <p>Regrades for assignments, exams, or participation can be submitted via this <a href="https://forms.gle/XY8Bq6gHM4JNf136A">Google Form</a> up to 48 hours after a grade is posted. Regrade requests should articulate, in a paragraph or less, what points are being requested and why the grade should be higher according to the rubric. This could be that the grader mis-entered the grade, did not realize that a student's work matched the rubric, or that the student provided a correct response which was not on the rubric.</p>
   <p>Our experience is that about 10% of regrades result in a grade change and a lower percentage have any effect on overall grades. In a large class such as this one, regrade requests can create substantial additional work for the course staff. We may delay responding to any regrade requests until the end of the quarter and may only address those which could impact a student's final grade.</p>
   <h2 id="resources">Online Resources and Collaboration</h2>
   <p>In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.</p>
   <p>While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. <strong>To be clear: looking at or submitting a student's assignment from a previous course offering is not allowed.</strong> If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!</p>
   <p>Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.</p>
   <p>The CSE department at the University of Washington, where Professor Epstein completed his Ph.D., had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilligan%27s_Island">Gilligan’s Island rule</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>After discussing with someone, get rid of all written records of the collaboration (no whiteboards, email, paper, etc.) and then engage in a totally unrelated activity like watching Gilligan’s Island before returning to the work.</blockquote>
   <p>In essence, feel free to talk to others, but take a break to ensure you’ve learned from the collaboration rather than copied. The reference is dated, swap it out for whatever Netflix show or other activity you're in to.</p>
   <p>Some of the assignments will be completed in pairs. For these assignments, your pair is treated as though you were one individual. You may use online resources, share code between your pair, etc., but may not attempt to pass off another pair's work as your own.</p>
   <h2 id="integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
   <p>Our hope is that you’re taking this class because you’re excited to build user interfaces and want to follow good principles for doing so. Our job as the course staff is to help facilitate your learning. The assignments, exams, and participation requirements in this course are designed to help toward that learning. Naturally, there will be ways to shortcut this learning to arrive at a desirable solution with the least amount of effort. But by doing so, you’re missing the opportunity to learn the topics.</p>
   <p>As discussed above, acknowledge your sources. Attempting to pass someone else’s work off as your own is not allowed. If you do so, you will receive a failing grade for the assignment or the entire course at the instructor’s discretion. The course staff will report the incident to UCI’s Office of Academic Integrity &amp; Student Conduct. What will follow will be unpleasant, just don’t do it.</p>
   <p>If you’re having problems in this course, come talk to the course staff. The shortcut isn’t worth it.</p>
   <p>For more info, take a look at <a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/index.php">UCI's academic integrity policy</a> and <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism">ACM's</a>. Talk to the course staff if you have additional questions.</p>
   <p>As an instructor, allowing students to share their work online, such as publicly on GitHub, poses a dilemma. The benefit is that it can contribute to your web presence, offering a browseable portfolio piece to potential employers. But it can also serve as an online resource for other current or future students to copy from, rather than learn from. We ask that you do not make your work in this class visible online unless it it distinguishably different from the course assignment (e.g., an extended personal portfolio or Ionic app).</p>
   <h2>Accomodations</h2>
   <p>If you think you need an accommodation for a physical, psychiatric, or learning disability, please let the course staff know as soon as possible. Some aspects of the course including assignments, in-class activities, and teaching style may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. If you have not already done so, consider contacting the Disability Services Center at <a href="mailto:dsc@uci.edu">dsc@uci.edu</a> or <a href="tel:949-824-7494">949-824-7494</a>. Information on registering with DSC is available at <a href="http://www.dsc.uci.edu/">http://www.dsc.uci.edu/</a>.</p>
   <h2>Further COVID-19 Thoughts</h2>
   <p>Like any course in the COVID-19 era, we've had to deviate from our typical course to support remote learning. Some changes might ultimately be nice improvements, while others will be quickly reverted when future offerings can return in-person.</p>
   <p>These are difficult circumstances to learn in as well as to teach in. But the course staff is committed to doing our best to make as productive of an experience as possible. If you have ideas for making the course more manageable, participatory, or otherwise a more positive experience, perhaps drawn from previous offerings you've experienced, do not heistate to share them with the course staff.</p>
